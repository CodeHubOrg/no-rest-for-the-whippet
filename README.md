## About this tutorial

This tutorial is split into a series of git tags. Each tag adds a certain part of new functionality to the REST API, up to the final tag, which demonstrates a fully working, tested REST API. For manipulating dogs.

Checkout the tags in order to view the REST API being built-up, step by step, in a test-driven way.

## Requirements

You need to install the following to get this tutorial working:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)

## Running the server

Make sure MongoDB is alive and running.

Run `npm start` to start the API server.

Alternatively, run `nodemon` to have Nodemon watch your files for changes and automatically restart the express server when changes are made.

## Running the tests

Run `npm test` to run the test suite.
